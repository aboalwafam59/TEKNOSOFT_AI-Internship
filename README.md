## Task 1 : Rule-Based Chatbot Implementation
Rule-based Chatbots
Rule-based chatbots are pretty straightforward. They use a predefined response database and follow set rules to determine appropriate replies. Although they can’t generate answers independently, their effectiveness hinges on the depth of the response database and the efficiency of their rules.

The simplest form of Rule-based Chatbots has one-to-one tables of inputs and their responses. These bots are extremely limited and can only respond to queries if they are an exact match with the inputs defined in their database.
Building a rule-based chatbot
 

This very simple rule-based chatbot will work by searching for specific keywords in user input. The keywords will help determine the desired action of the user (user’s intent). Once the intent is identified, the bot will pick out an appropriate response.

Role of intent in a rule-based chatbot
The list of keywords and a dictionary of responses will be built up manually based on the specific use case for the chatbot.

We’ll be designing a very simple chatbot for a bank that can respond to greetings (Hi, Hello, etc.) and answer questions about the bank’s hours of operation.

A flow of how the chatbot would process inputs is shown below:
